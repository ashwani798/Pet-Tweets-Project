# Pet Tweets Project üêæ

This project is a Django web application that allows users to post and manage tweets about pets. The app includes a variety of features, demonstrating different aspects of Django and web development:

## Features:
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionality using Django's built-in authentication system.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete functionality for pet tweets, with confirmation pages for actions like deletion.
3. **File Uploads**: Users can upload images for their tweets, using Django's FileField and media settings.
4. **Template Inheritance**: The app uses Django's template inheritance to extend base templates, ensuring consistency across pages.
5. **Form Handling**: Dynamic forms rendered using Django forms (form.as_p), with CSRF protection.
6. **URL Routing**: Clear, user-friendly URLs, including dynamic paths for specific tweets and actions.
7. **Bootstrap Integration**: The app is styled using Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly UI.
